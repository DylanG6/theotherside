## Welcome to The Other Side

The Other Side is a lawn mowing service focused on bringing you high quality work for a reasonable and negotiable price.  My friend Ben and I started this business as a way to help the community while saving for college.  We love what we do, and we would love to help YOU make your lawn look how you want it.  After all, the grass is always greener on The Other Side.

We can reduce the cost of a lawn mowing session if you provide a lawnmower(s) and/or gas.

### Pricing

We have very flexible pricing that averages around $8 per 1,000 square feet
