## Welcome to The Other Side

My friend Ben and I started this business in order to save money for college.  We love to work outside and help others.

We will provide lawn mowers and gas for a higher price if you wish.

### Pricing

We have very flexible pricing that averages around $8 per 1,000 square feet
